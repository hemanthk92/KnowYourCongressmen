Galvanize Cap Stone Project: Congressional Voting Records \n
KnowYourCongressmen is a website with a set of tools that use Data Science and Machine Learning to better evaluate a Congress member. The website has two tools, a Voting Record Visualizer and also a Missing Vote Predictor. \n
When voter's cast their ballot in November 2016, they will have plenty of information to make an informed decision on voting for a president but this isn't the case for local congressional elections. There are no national televized debates nor round the clock media coverage yet as we all know how critical of a role these members play in our country's policy. \n
I used Congressional Voting Record Data and created the Voting Record Visualizer to evaluate the performance of a Congress member and to help answer the common questions about Congressional Representatives. Is my representative a "maverick"? Did my representative vote inline with their campaign promises? How idelogically extreme is the voting record of my congressional member? \n
Also, many times a representative missing votes can be indicative of his/her's political stances. I created a Missing Vote Predictor to predict the votes a Congress member may have missed or decided not to vote on.
