# KnowYourCongressmen 
####Galvanize Cap Stone Project: Congressional Voting Records <br /><br />
KnowYourCongressmen is a website with a set of tools that use Data Science and Machine Learning to better evaluate a Congress member. The website has two tools, a Voting Record Visualizer and a Missing Vote Predictor. <br /> 
When voter's cast their ballot in November 2016, they will have plenty of information to make an informed decision on voting for a president but this isn't the case for local congressional elections. There are no national televized debates nor round the clock media coverage yet as we all know how critical of a role these members play in our country's policy. <br /> </br>
The Voting Record Visualizer uses Congressional Voting Record Data to evaluate the performance of a Congress member and to help answer common questions about Congressional Representatives. Is my representative a "maverick"? Did my representative vote inline with their campaign promises? How idelogically extreme is the voting record of my congressional member? <br /> </br>
Many times a representative missing votes can be indicative of his/her's political stances. Congressional members have a duty to vote but they sometimes abstain due to having a different position than the majority or being afraid of the political repurcusions of voting. I created a Missing Vote Predictor to predict the votes a Congress member missed.
